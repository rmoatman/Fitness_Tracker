## Description

This app is a daily Workout Tracker powered by an Express server using a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema.  It allows the user to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day.  It accumulates the data and displays the most recent workout statistics.  A user Dashboard provides statistics regarding workouts for the past 7 days.

When utilized, this tracker will allow a consumer to reach his goals more quickly because he will be able to instantly track his progress.  Consumers will be able to add exercises to the most recent workout plan, create a new workout plan, and view the combined weight/duration of multiple exercises for the past seven days.
